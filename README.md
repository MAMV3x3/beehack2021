The app will allow students to create profiles, search for mentors based on specific criteria, and connect with mentors through messaging and video conferencing. The app have several key features, including: Profile creation: Students can create profiles that include information about their field of study, experience, and areas of expertise. Mentor search: Students can search for mentors based on criteria such as field of study, experience, and location. Messaging and video conferencing: Once a mentor and mentee have connected, they can communicate through the app's messaging feature and schedule video conferences to discuss their mentoring relationship. Mentor ratings and feedback: Mentees will be able to rate their mentors and provide feedback on their experience (work in progress). This project is open-source and welcomes contributions from developers, designers, and anyone interested in helping improve the app.
